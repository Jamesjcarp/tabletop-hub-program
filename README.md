# DnD music program

This projects is still in early developmental stages using a lot of hard coding for swapping assets.
current development goals:
  * Re-add overlay functionality from winforms prototype to new WPF version.
  * update battle map to allow for animations to play
  * add map and overlay options to main UI window to allow for runtime changes to each.
  * add window to create assets on user side to allow for easy upload of files for use such as music or maps.
  * allow for editing of assets.
  * create stats window for use of keeping track of creatures in battle enabling clicking on the creature icon to pull up th e window.
  * remove prototype files from winforms version (DnD music program).

This is a personal project created by me to allow myself to more effectivly run ttrpg games for my friends. The alternatives I found online I think are too restrictive and/or pay walled. So I decided to create my own. This program makes use of multiple running threads to run three seperate windows simultniously. This allows for online play where you can stream just the window that you want your players to see while still being able to keep the info you don't want them seeing on the other UI window. This allows for more effective running of games with less akward pausing to set up music, sounds, battles and screen effects.
